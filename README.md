# departures-board [![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/BY--NC--SA%204.0%20License-grey?style=flat&logo=creativecommons&logoColor=white)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

This is an ESP32 based Departures Board replicating those at many UK railway stations (using data provided by National Rail's public API), London Underground Arrivals boards (using data provided by TfL) and UK wide bus stops (using data provided by bustimes.org). This implementation uses a 3.12" OLED display panel with SSD1322 display controller onboard, plus an optional TTP223 touch sensor. STL files are also provided for 3D printing the custom desktop case.

The default `esp32dev` PlatformIO environment targets the original SSD1322 OLED board. To build for an ESP32-2432S028R Cheap Yellow Display (CYD), use the `cyd` environment; it enables the integrated ILI9341 TFT, BOOT button input, backlight control, and a native 320x240 display layout. CYD National Rail service and feed rows use the fixed-width `u8g2_font_7x14B_tf` font at 1x scale.

## Quick Start

### What you'll need

1. An ESP32 D1 Mini board (or clone) - either USB-C or Micro-USB version with CH9102 recommended. For example, from [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005972627549.html).
2. A 3.12" 256x64 OLED Display Panel with SSD1322 display controller onboard. For example, from [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008558326731.html).
3. A 3D printed case using the [STL](https://github.com/gadec-uk/departures-board/tree/main/stl) files provided. If you don't have a 3D printer, you can use a 3D print service, local library or group.
4. Optionally, a TTP223 touch sensor (for easily switching modes / stations). For example, from [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007850732859.html). If fitted, the touch sensor should be glued to the inside of one of the walls of the top part of the case with the *sensor* side against the case.
5. For National Rail, the board supports using either the Rail Delivery Group feeds (recommended) or the legacy OpenLDBWS feed. Both feeds are free of charge and provide identical information but the legacy OpenLDBWS feed may be discontinued in the future. To use the Rail Delivery Group feeds, you will need a [Live Departure Board 1.1](https://raildata.org.uk/dataProduct/P-d81d6eaf-8060-4467-a339-1c833e50cbbe/overview) consumer key and (optionally) a [Service Details 1.1](https://raildata.org.uk/dataProduct/P-4dec1247-d040-4290-80a4-639dfac54a92/overview) consumer key. Alternatively, if you prefer to use the legacy OpenLDBWS feed, you can register for a token [here](https://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration).
6. By default, weather data is sourced from Open-Meteo. If you prefer to use OpenWeather (which usually provides slightly more localised weather conditions) you will need an OpenWeather Map API token (these are also free, sign-up for a free developer account [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)).
7. Some intermediate soldering skills.

A step-by-step guide to obtaining the API keys is available [here](https://departures-board.github.io/Departures-Board-API-Keys-Guide.pdf).

### Preparing the OLED display for 4-Wire SPI Mode

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd176b57-ced6-486b-9a0d-9eee150dc813" align="right">
As supplied, the display is usually shipped with 8-bit 80XX mode enabled. This needs to be changed to 4-Wire SPI mode by removing one link and adding another (the image shows where to make these changes on the rear of the circuit board).

### Wiring Guide

Solder the 4 SPI connections, plus power and ground. The wires **MUST** be soldered to the **BACK** of the ESP32 Mini board (the side without the components) to enable it to sit in place in the case. You can solder directly to the pins on the OLED screen or for the best fit (if you are a more experienced solderer) de-solder and remove the header pins and solder directly to the board. You cannot use Dupont connectors, they will not fit the custom case design.

| OLED Pin | ESP32 Mini Pin |
|:---------|:-------------:|
| 1 VSS | GND |
| 2 VCC_IN | 3.3v |
| 4 D0/CLK | IO18 |
| 5 D1/DIN | IO23 |
| 14 D/C# | IO5 |
| 16 CS# | IO26 |

| TTP223 Pin | ESP32 Mini Pin |
|:---------|:-------------:|
| 1 GND | GND |
| 2 I/O | IO34 |
| 3 VCC | 3.3v |

### Installing the firmware

The project uses the Arduino framework and the ESP32 v3.3.9 core. If you want to build from source, you'll need [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org). The software is designed for, and makes use of, a dual-core ESP32 processor. If you attempt to target and compile for a single core ESP32 variant the experience will be suboptimal at best.

Build the original OLED firmware with `pio run -e esp32dev`, or the CYD firmware with `pio run -e cyd`.

The easiest way to install the firmware for the first time is to use the online web based installer [here](https://departures-board.github.io). You will need to use Chrome, Edge or Firefox as your browser as Safari does not support Web Serial.

Alternatively, you can download pre-compiled firmware images from the [releases](https://github.com/gadec-uk/departures-board/releases). These can be installed over the USB serial connection using [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool). If you have python installed, install with *pip install esptool*. For convenience, a pre-compiled executable version for Windows is included [here](https://github.com/gadec-uk/departures-board/tree/main/esptool).

If the board is not recognised you are probably using a version with the CP2104 USB-to-Serial chip. Drivers for the CP2104 are [here](https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)

Attach the ESP32 Mini board via it's USB port and use the following command to flash the firmware:

```
esptool.py --chip esp32 --baud 460800 write_flash -z \
  0x1000 bootloader.bin \
  0xe000 boot_app0.bin \
  0x8000 partitions.bin \
  0x10000 firmware.bin
```

The tool should automatically find the correct serial port. If it fails to, you can manually specify the correct port by adding *--port COMx* (replace *COMx* with your actual port, e.g. COM3, /dev/ttyUSB0, etc.).

If using the pre-compiled esptool.exe version on Windows, save the esptool.exe and the four firmware (.bin) files to the same directory. Open a command prompt (Windows Key + R, type cmd and press enter) and change to the directory you saved the files into. Now type the following command on one line and press enter:
```
.\esptool --chip esp32 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 bootloader.bin 0xe000 boot_app0.bin 0x8000 partitions.bin 0x10000 firmware.bin
```

Subsequent updates can be carried out automatically over-the-air or you can manually update from the Web GUI.

### First time configuration

WiFiManager is used to setup the initial WiFi connection on first boot. The ESP32 will broadcast a temporary WiFi network named "Departures Board", connect to the network and follow the on-screen instructions. You can also watch a video walk-through of setup and configuration process below (this video shows an earlier version of the firmware, but the process is the same).
[![Departures Board Setup Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/176f0489-d846-42de-913f-eb838d9ab941)](https://youtu.be/PZVyE_SoLBU)

Once the ESP32 has established an Internet connection, the next step is to enter your API keys (if you do not enter a National Rail token, the board will only operate in Tube and Bus modes). Finally, select a station location. Start typing the location name and valid choices will be displayed as you type.

### Web GUI

At start-up, the ESP32's IP address is displayed. To change the station or to configure other miscellaneous settings, open the web page at that address. The settings available are:
- **Board Mode** - switch between National Rail Departures, London Underground Arrivals or UK Bus Stops modes.
- **Station** - start typing a few characters of a station name and select from the drop-down station picker displayed (National Rail mode).
- **Only show services calling at** - filter services based on *calling at* location (National Rail mode - if you want to see the next trains *to* a particular station).
- **Only show these platforms** - filter services based on the platform they depart from. Note: there are many services for which platform number is not supplied, these would also be filtered out.
- **Add to Scheduler** - adds the current configured station/tube/bus stop to the scheduler (see schedule tab) to switch based on time of day.
- **Add to Carousel** - adds the current configured station/tube/bus stop to the carousel (see schedule tab) to switch views after a period of time.
- **Underground Station** - start typing a few characters of an Underground or DLR station name and select from the drop-down station picker displayed (London Underground mode).
- **Filter by Line** - select the desired underground line or all lines for all arrivals.
- **Filter by Direction** - select the desired direction or any direction for all arrivals.
- **Bus Stop ATCO code** - type the ATCO number of the bus stop you want to monitor (see [below](#bus-stop-atco-codes) for details).
- **Only show these Bus services** - filter buses by service numbers (enter a list of the service numbers, comma separated).
- **Recently verified ATCO codes** - quickly select from recently used bus stop ATCO codes.
#### Options tab ####
- **Brightness** - adjusts the brightness of the OLED screen.
- **Show the date on screen** - displays the date in the upper-right corner (useful if you're also using this as a desk clock).
- **Show current weather at station/bus stop** - optionally display weather conditions at the selected station or bus stop.
- **Include bus replacement services** - optionally include bus replacement services (National Rail mode).
- **Show station messages** - displays station and service messages (Rail and Tube modes).
- **Show service location** - displays the current location of the next tube train that is due to arrive (Tube mode).
- **Show platform numbers if available** - deselecting this option will hide platform numbers (National Rail).
- **Show service ordinal numbers** - displays "2nd","3rd","4th" etc. next to the service times (National Rail).
- **Show service last seen location** - adds the last reported location and time of a service to the Calling at list (National Rail).
- **Wait for Calling at list to complete** - waits for the Calling at list to finish scrolling before changing the primary service.
- **Wait for Messages or RSS to complete** - waits for the current service message or RSS headline feed to finish scrolling before changing the primary service.
- **Full screen clock if no train services** - displays the full screen, Network SouthEast style station clock if there are no scheduled services at the selected railway station.
- **Enable automatic firmware updates at startup** - automatically checks for AND installs the latest firmware from this repository when the system starts up.
- **Enable daily check for firmware updates** - when enabled, the system will check for and install any updates just after midnight if the board is powered on.
- **Enable overnight sleep mode (screensaver)** - if you're running the board 24/7, you can help prevent screen burn-in by enabling this option overnight.
- **Switch off display during sleep mode** - turns off the display completely during sleep mode, otherwise displays the date & time.
- **Full screen clock during sleep mode** - displays the full screen station clock during sleep mode.
#### Schedule tab ####
- **Enable scheduler** - automatically switches between views based on the configured time of each entry in the scheduler list below.
- **Enable carousel** - automatically switches between views based on the configured view time of each entry in the carousel list below.
#### Advanced Tab ####
- **Enable touch sensor** - a tap switches between configured modes (rail/tube/bus) or wakes from sleep. If the Scheduler or Carousel mode is active, a tap switch to the next location in the list. Obviously, do not enable this option if you have not installed a TTP223 touch sensor.
- **Wake from sleep by touch for** - if the board is in screensaver mode and the touch sensor is enabled, a tap will wake the board and it will remain awake for the selected number of minutes (the countdown timer resets on each tap).
- **Long press displays full screen clock** - a long tap switches to the full screen station clock. A short tap will revert to normal operation.
- **Flip the display 180°** - Rotates the display (the case design provides two different viewing angles depending on orientation).
- **Set custom hostname for this board** - change the hostname from the default "DeparturesBoard", useful if you are running multiple boards.
- **Custom (non-UK) time zone (only for clock)** - if you're not based in the UK you can set the clock to display in your local time zone (see [below](#custom-time-zones) for details).
- **Suppress calling at / information messages** - removes all horizontally scrolling text (much lower functionality but less distracting).
- **Increase API refresh rate** - Reduces the interval between data refreshes (National Rail mode).
- **Display RSS news headlines feed** - Displays the top headlines from the selected feed (Rail/Tube mode).
- **Prioritise RSS headlines feed** - Displays headlines before other network service messages.
- **Display departures offset by** - Displays future (or past) services offset by the selected time. This does not affect the clock display (Rail mode).
- **Rail data source** - Select which api feed should be used for National Rail mode (only feeds with api keys present are shown).

A drop-down menu (top-right) adds the following options:
- **Check for Updates** - manually checks for and optionally installs any updates to the firmware. Also displays the release notes of the latest firmware.
- **Edit API Keys** - view/edit your National Rail, OpenWeather Map and Transport for London API keys.
- **Edit RSS Feeds** - loads the RSS Feeds Editor where you can add/edit/delete custom headline feeds.
- **Clear WiFi Settings** - deletes the stored WiFi credentials and restarts in WiFiManager mode (useful to change WiFi network).
- **Restart System** - restarts the ESP32.

#### Other Web GUI Endpoints

A few other urls have been implemented, primarily for debugging/developer use:
- **/factoryreset** - deletes all configuration information, api keys and WiFi credentials. The entire setup process will need to be repeated.
- **/update** - for manual firmware updates. Download the latest binary from the [releases](https://github.com/gadec-uk/departures-board/releases). Only the **firmware.bin** file should be uploaded via */update*. The other .bin files are not used for upgrades. This method is *not* recommended for normal use.
- **/info** - displays some basic information about the current running state.
- **/formatffs** - formats the filing system, erasing the configuration files (but not the WiFi credentials).
- **/dir** - displays a (basic) directory listing of the file system with the ability to view/delete files.
- **/upload** - upload a file to the file system.
- **/control** - an endpoint for automation of sleep mode. Takes optional parameters *sleep* and *clock* - e.g. /control?sleep=1&clock=0 will force sleep mode and turn off the display completely. /control?sleep=0 will revert to normal operation. Always returns current state as json.

### Bus Stop ATCO codes
Every UK bus stop has a unique ATCO code number. To find the ATCO code of the stop you want to monitor, go to [bustimes.org/search](https://bustimes.org/search) and type a location in the search box. Select the location from the list of places shown and then select the particular stop you want from the list. The ATCO code is shown on the stop information page. After entering the code in the Departures Board setup screen, tap the **Verify** button and the location will be shown confirming your selection. You must use the **Verify** button *before* you can save changes. Up to ten of the most recently verified ATCO codes are saved and can be selected from a dropdown list for quick access. The bustimes map and search facility are also embedded in the Bus mode configuration screen from firmware B2.3 onwards.

### Custom Time Zones
To set a custom time zone for the departure board clock, you will need to enter the POSIX time zone string for your location. Some examples are `CST6CDT,M3.2.0/2,M11.1.0/2` for Canada (Central Time) and `AEST-10AEDT,M10.1.0,M4.1.0/3` for Australia (Eastern Time). The easiest way to find the correct syntax is to ask your favourite AI chat engine *"What is the POSIX time zone string for ..."*. Note that changing the time zone only affects the clock (and date) display. Service times are *always* shown in UK time.
